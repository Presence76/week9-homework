            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Audio is a big part of my life. I learned piano when I was yong and because I have bad eyesite, so most of the stories are in audio form instead of books.
                This website is a photograph demonstration of my everyday audio gear. I will describe the use of them, list some of the characteristics and states, also describe their sound profile for those are interested.
                I hope this website will give beigners an idea what is audio gear why you might need them rather than your phone or a earbud and show those who share the same passion my opinion.

                        <br>
                        USE: In door use for Jazz and classic Music, FPS Games<br>

                        This is a closed back headphone which is very common, but this particular one is special as it has some advanced technology to overcome some of the disadvantage of closed back headphones.<br>
